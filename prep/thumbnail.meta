	@u Aggressively compress images and videos

description
	Resize image and/or video files. For video files adjust also frame rate and audio and video bit rate. By default, write output for `FILE.EXT` to `FILE_tn.EXT` 
	
synopsis
	**thumbnail** \[*OPTION*\] *FILE1* \[*FILE2*, ...\]

options
	@p **-i**     @t replace *FILEs* in place   
	@p **-r** *R*   @t resize *FILEs* by *R*% (default: *R*=75)
	@p **-o** *F*   @t write output to file *F*; exit after first input file 

arguments
	*FILE* is an image file recognized by GraphicsMagick or a video file recognized by ffmpeg.

installation
		curl -LO https://github.com/bashdroid/thumbnail/archive/master.tar.gz
		tar xzf master.tar.gz
		cd thumbnail-master
		make install
	
	Depending on your system, you might need to run `make install` as root.
	
	If you don't need a manual, you may just download and run **thumbnail** with your preferred tools, e.g.:

		curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bashdroid/thumbnail/master/thumbnail
		chmod u+x thumbnail

rationale
	Ordinary image and video compression methods usually have a limited compression rate. thumbnail allows arbitrary compression rates. With arbitrary quality loss, of course.

examples
	* Resize `img.jpg` at the default rate and write output to `img_tn.jpg`:

	    thumbnail img.jpg

	* Replace `vid.mpg` by a version resized at rate 50%:

	    thumbnail -ir50 vid.mpg

dependencies
	* graphicsmagick
	* ffmpeg
